Objects
Promises
This Keyword
Arrow Functions
File: arrowfunc.js

Practice of modern ES6 arrow functions, showing concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript.
Break & Continue
File: break&continue.js

Demonstrates the use of break and continue statements in loops, which allow us to exit the loop early or skip the current iteration.
Bulb HTML and JS Example
Files: bulb.html, bulb.js

A simple interactive example with an HTML page and corresponding JavaScript to simulate a light bulb turning on and off.
Callback Functions
File: callbackfunc.js

Shows how to use callback functions to handle asynchronous operations and pass one function as an argument to another.
Comparison Operators
File: comparisonopr.js

Practice of different comparison operators in JavaScript, including strict (===) and loose (==) equality.
ForEach Loop
File: foreachloop.js

Example of how to use the forEach() array method to iterate over array elements.
For-In Loop
File: forinloop.js

Demonstrates how to use the for-in loop to iterate over the properties of an object.
For Loop
File: forloop.js

Basic example of using the traditional for loop to iterate over values.
New Keyword and Constructor Functions
File: newinjs.js

Shows how to use the new keyword to create objects from constructor functions.
Objects
File: object.js

A practice file for creating and manipulating JavaScript objects, including methods and properties.
Promises
File: promises.js

An example that shows how to use Promises in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, with resolve, reject, and .then() chains.
This Keyword
File: this.js

Demonstrates how the this keyword behaves in different contexts in JavaScript, including inside functions and object methods.
